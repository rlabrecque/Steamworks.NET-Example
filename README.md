Steamworks.NET Example
=======

This is a sample project for [Steamworks.NET](//github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) it is intended to show functionality and a potential usage scenario.

It is heavily based upon the Steamworks Example 'SpaceWar' included with the Steamworks SDK. It currently only features the `StatsAndAchievements` class from SpaceWar.

Check out the [Steamworks.NET Test](//github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET-Test) project for a playground showing you how you could call every Steam function.

This sample is available in the public domain (where acceptable.) Please view [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for more details.

This project is usually built using the latest version of Unity. As such it is only expected to build and run out of the box on the version specified in [ProjectVersion.txt](ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt) or newer.
